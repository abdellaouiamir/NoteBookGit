Ah, I see! The three types of shells in Unix-like operating systems, based on their usage and interaction methods, are:

1. **Login Shell**:
   - A login shell is initiated when a user logs into the system. This can happen through a console, remote login via SSH, or other login methods.
   - When a login shell starts, it reads and executes commands from initialization files like `/etc/profile`, `~/.profile`, `~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.login` (depending on the shell being used).
   - Example: When you log in to a server via SSH, you are interacting with a login shell.

2. **Non-Login Shell**:
   - A non-login shell is typically started by an already logged-in user, usually through a terminal emulator in a graphical environment.
   - It does not read the login initialization files. Instead, it reads files like `~/.bashrc` (for `bash`), which are specific to non-login shells.
   - Example: Opening a terminal emulator in a desktop environment starts a non-login shell.

3. **Interactive Shell**:
   - An interactive shell is any shell that reads commands from the user input (standard input) and executes them. It provides a prompt to the user and is used for day-to-day command execution.
   - Both login and non-login shells can be interactive if they accept user input and display a prompt.
   - Example: When you open a terminal and start typing commands, you are using an interactive shell.

4. **Non-Interactive Shell**:
   - A non-interactive shell is used to execute commands from a script. It does not provide a prompt or accept user input interactively.
   - Non-interactive shells are used for running scripts and automated tasks.
   - Example: Running a shell script with `bash script.sh` uses a non-interactive shell.

These categories can overlap; for example, an interactive shell can be either a login or a non-login shell. The distinction helps to understand how different shells behave and which initialization files they read.
